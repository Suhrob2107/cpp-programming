# Keep These Tips in Mind While Learning Programming

1. Learn and code every day, consistency is important.
2. Write it down - plan your code before you start coding and understand the input to your program and the output from your code.
3. Learn to debug your code - look at the code line by line to see how it works.
4. Surround yourself with other people who are learning. Teach each other.
5. Learn taking notes.
6. Build something, anything you would enjoy while coding. Be unique.
7. Focus on 1 thing! Take small steps, but every day, consistency is very important again.
8. Learn to ask GOOD questions to others:
  - G: Give context on what you are trying to do, clearly describing the problem.
  - O: Outline the things you have already tried to fix the issue.
  - O: Offer your best guess as to what the problem might be. It helps the person who is helping you not only know what you're thinking but also know that you've thought of something yourself.
  - D: Demonstrate what's going on. Include the code, the tracing error message, and an explanation of the steps you followed that resulted in the error. That way, the person helping doesn't have to try to recreate the problem.

14. C++ Program to Find the Size of int, float, double, and char.
15. C++ Program to Swap Two Numbers.
16. C++ program that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures based on user input. You can also add conversions for Kelvin.
17. C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd.
18. C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Positive or Negative.
19. C++ Program to Check Whether a Character is a Vowel or Consonant.
20. C++ Program to find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers.
21. C++ Program to find if the entered year is a leap year or not.
22. C++ program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers. You can also add error handling for division by zero.
22. BMI Calculator: Create a program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height input. Provide a classification of whether the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Use cin, cout. Formula: bmi = weight / (height * height)
23. Nested condition
* Get the age and membership_status as user input. membership_status can be only Y or y. So, if the age is bigger or equal to 18 and if the user is a member of our shop, we provide a 10% discount, else we charge fully.
* Write a simple chatbot program using nested conditions.
24. Write a program to calculate taxes, with the following conditions:
 * If the salary is less than $1500, then there are no taxes
 * If the salary is from 1501 to 3000 $ (1501<= salary < 3000) then the tax should be 10%
 * If the salary is from 3001 to 5000 $ (3001 <= salary < 5000) then the tax should be 20%
 * If the salary is above $5000, then the tax should be 30%
Hint: Formula for finding tax (salary * percentage) / 100
You must output:
 * Tax percentage
 * Salary after taxes
25. Switch
 * Program to use switch statement. Display Monday to Sunday.
 * Program to display arithmetic operator using switch case.
26. C++ Program to Find all Roots of a Quadratic equation.
27. C++ Program to Check Whether a Character is an Alphabet or not.
